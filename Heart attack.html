            <div class="box">
                <p>High blood pressure happens when the force on the walls of blood vessels (caused by the blood within
                    them) is more than normal. This means the heart has to work harder and the blood vessels are under
                    more
                    strain, making it a major risk factor for heart disease, stroke and other serious conditions.
                    Healthcare
                    professionals sometimes call high blood pressure 'hypertension'.</p>
            </div>
            <h1>What are the symptoms of high blood pressure?</h1>
            <div class="box">
                <p>The vast majority of people with high blood pressure do not know they have it, until it causes a
                    complication such as a stroke or heart attack. Usually high blood pressure is only picked up if
                    blood
                    pressure is checked routinely, or as part of checks for another medical problem.</p>
                <p>
                    Occasionally if it is very high, you can get headaches. Even more occasionally, some people feel a
                    bit
                    dizzy, or their vision can be affected.

                </p>

                <p>
                    Other than the blood pressure reading being high, there isn't usually anything for the doctor to
                    find on
                    examination either. If blood pressure has been high for some time, or very high, there can be
                    changes in
                    the blood vessels at the back of the eye.</p>

            <h1>Treatment</h1>
            <div class="box">

                <p>If you are diagnosed as having high blood pressure (hypertension) then you are likely to be examined
                    by
                    your doctor and have some routine tests which include:</p>
                <p>
                    A urine test to check if you have protein or blood in your urine.
                    A blood test to check that your kidneys are working normally and to check your cholesterol level and
                    sugar (glucose) level.
                    A heart tracing, called an electrocardiogram (ECG).
                    The purpose of the examination and tests is to:
                </p>

                <p>
                    Rule out (or diagnose) a secondary cause of high blood pressure, such as kidney disease.
                    Check to see if the high blood pressure has affected the heart.
                    Check for other risk factors such as a high cholesterol level or diabetes.</p>

            <h1>Can I get my blood pressure down without taking medication?</h1>
            <div class="box">
                <p>
                    Sometimes there is quite a bit you can do with lifestyle changes, and in some people this may help
                    them
                    to avoid medication. In particular, the following help:

                    Losing weight if you are overweight.
                    Reducing the salt you have in your food.
                    Taking regular exercise.
                    Stopping smoking doesn't reduce your blood pressure as such, but smoking and high blood pressure put
                    you
                    at risk of the same conditions. So if you can quit smoking, you'll reduce your risk of strokes,
                    heart
                    attacks, etc
                </p>
            </div>
            <h1>What if I need medication to lower my blood pressure?</h1>
            <div class="box">
                </p> As you can see in our leaflet on home and ambulatory blood pressure, doctors rarely treat high
                blood
                pressure on the basis of a single reading. Instead, guidelines suggest they should check your average
                blood pressure at home or using a machine you wear for 24 hours to measure your 'ambulatory blood
                pressure'.
                <p>
                <p>

                    If you have 'grade 1 hypertension' - blood pressure of 140/90 mm Hg in clinic or average blood
                    pressure
                    of 135/85 mm Hg, doctors will check your 10-year risk of heart attack or stroke. This takes into
                    account
                    several factors including your age, gender, cholesterol levels and other medical conditions, as well
                    as
                    your blood pressure.
                </p>

                <p>

                    Until now, treatment with medicines for high blood pressure has been recommended if your 10-year
                    risk is
                    above 20%. New draft guidelines from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE)
                    now
                    recommend starting treatment if your 10-year risk is over 10%. That means many more people may be
                    offered tablets to protect them against heart attack and stroke.
                </p>
                <p>

                    There are many different medicines for high blood pressure. They work in various different ways.
                    Your
                    doctor will advise on the best one for you. If it doesn't work, or you have side-effects, there are
                    plenty of other options. The idea is to find you one or more pills which suit you, and which control
                    your blood pressure. Once you and your doctor have cracked it, you'll need to keep taking your
                    medication long-term to make sure you stay protected. Your blood pressure will be checked regularly
                    and
                    medication adjusted if need be.
