                <p>
                    Chickenpox causes spots (a rash) and can make a child feel generally unwell. Treatment aims to ease
                    symptoms until the illness goes. Full recovery is usual in children aged under 12 years. Serious
                    complications are rare but are more likely to occur in children with a poor immune system, such as
                    those
                    on chemotherapy.
                </p>
                <h3>What is chickenpox?</h3>
                <div class="box">
                    <p>Chickenpox is an infection caused by the varicella-zoster virus. Most children have chickenpox at
                        some stage. Most commonly, children get chickenpox before the age of 10 years. The immune system
                        makes proteins called antibodies during the infection. These fight the virus and then provide
                        lifelong protection against it (immunity). Therefore, it is uncommon to have more than one bout
                        of
                        chickenpox in your lifetime.</p>
                </div>
                <h3>Chickenpox symptoms</h3>
                <div class="box">
                    <li1>High temperature (fever), aches and headache often start a day or so before a rash appears.
                    </li1>
                    <li2>
                        Spots (rash). Spots appear in crops. They develop into small blisters and are itchy. They can be
                        anywhere on the body. Several crops may develop over several days. Some children may be covered
                        in
                        spots; others have only a few or even none. The rash starts off looking like red spots, which
                        then
                        blister, and then scab over
                    </li2>
                    <li3>Loss of appetite or feeding problems.</li3>
                </div>
                <h3>What are the possible complications?</h3>
                <div class="box">
                    <p>Most of the time, children with chickenpox recover fully and have no complications. Uncommonly,
                        one
                        or more of the following complications can occur.</p>
                    <li>The spots do not usually scar unless they are badly scratched.</li>
                    <li>Some spots become infected with germs (bacteria) in some cases. This is the most common
                        complication
                        in children. If this occurs, the surrounding skin becomes red and sore. Antibiotics in the form
                        of
                        creams or medicine may then be needed

                    </li>
                    <li>Inflammation of the lung (pneumonia) and inflammation of the brain (encephalitis) are rare
                        complications.</li>
                    <li>Vary rarely, other serious complications develop. For example:
                        Reye's syndrome. (a very rare condition with brain and liver problems).
                        Inflammation of the heart muscle (myocarditis).
                        Kidney inflammation (glomerulonephritis).
                        Appendicitis.
                        Ataxia (problems co-ordinating movements).
                        Inflammation of the pancreas (pancreatitis).
                        Henoch-Sch√∂nlein purpura (a condition that can affect the kidneys).
                        Inflammation of the testes (orchitis).</li>

                <h3>What is the treatment for chickenpox?</h3>
                <h1>For most children</h1>
                <div class="box">
                    <p>Treatment is mainly aimed at easing symptoms and trying to make your child as comfortable as
                        possible
                        whilst the immune system deals with the virus.</p>
                    <li>Advice on dealing with a high temperature (fever) is detailed below.</li>
                    <li>A soothing cream (emollient) may help the itch. Calamine lotion is the one most used, although
                        it is
                        not known how effective it is.</li>
                    <li>Keep fingernails cut short to stop deep scratching.</li>
                    <li>Dress children comfortably so they are not cold or overheated. Use cool smooth fabrics such as
                        cotton.</li>
