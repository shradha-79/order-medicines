                    Type 1 diabetes is the type of diabetes that typically develops in children and in young adults. In
                    type
                    1 diabetes the body stops making insulin and the blood sugar (glucose) level goes very high.
                    Treatment
                    to control the blood glucose level is with insulin injections and a healthy diet. Other treatments
                    aim
                    to reduce the risk of complications. They include reducing blood pressure if it is high and advice
                    to
                    lead a healthy lifestyle.

                <h3>What is type 1 diabetes?</h3>
                <p>
                    Diabetes mellitus (just called diabetes from now on) occurs when the level of sugar (glucose) in the
                    blood becomes higher than normal. There are two main types of diabetes. These are called type 1
                    diabetes
                    and type 2 diabetes. <br>

                    Type 1 diabetes usually first develops in children or young adults. In the UK about 1 in 300 people
                    develop type 1 diabetes at some stage. <br>

                    With type 1 diabetes the illness usually develops quite quickly, over days or weeks, as the pancreas
                    <br>
                    stops making insulin. It is treated with insulin injections and a healthy diet (see below).

                <h3>What are the symptoms of type 1 diabetes?
                </h3>
                <p>
                    The symptoms that usually occur when you first develop type 1 diabetes are:
                </p>
                <li>You are very thirsty a lot of the time.</li>
                <li>You pass a lot of urine.</li>
                <li>Tiredness, weight loss and feeling generally unwell.</li>
                <p>The above symptoms tend to develop quite quickly, over a few days or weeks. After treatment is
                    started,
                    the symptoms soon settle and go. However, without treatment, the blood sugar (glucose) level becomes
                    very high and acids form in the bloodstream (ketoacidosis). If this persists you will become lacking
                    in
                    fluid in the body (dehydrated) and are likely to lapse into a coma and die. (The reason you make a
                    lot
                    of urine and become thirsty is because glucose leaks into your urine, which pulls out extra water
                    through the kidneys.)</p>

                <h3>Treatment of complications</h3>
                <p>
                    Too much insulin can make the blood glucose level go too low (hypoglycaemia, sometimes called a
                    'hypo').
                    This can cause you to feel sweaty, confused and unwell; you may lapse into a coma. Emergency
                    treatment
                    of hypoglycaemia is with sugar, sweet drinks, or a glucagon injection (a hormone which has the
                    opposite
                    effect to insulin). Then you should eat a starchy snack such as a sandwich.
